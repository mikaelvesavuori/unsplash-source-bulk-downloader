# Unsplash Source Bulk Downloader

Helper tool to grab a user-specified number of random images (in a chosen resolution) from Unsplash Source, and then compress them.

## Install

Install it globally by running `npm install -g` in the repo.

## Usage

Use it from the Terminal or your CLI of choice by running `unsplash`. You will be prompted to specify desired image resolution and number of images. They will be downloaded to a `images` folder within your current working directory. While processing the images, a `temp` folder will exist briefly where the uncompressed images reside.
